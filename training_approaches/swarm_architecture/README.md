# Swarm Intelligence Architecture

## Overview

The Swarm Architecture implements a revolutionary approach to AI systems using multiple tiny specialized models (10M-500M parameters) working together instead of a single large model. Inspired by ant colonies where simple agents achieve complex behaviors through coordination.

## Why Swarm Architecture?

### Traditional Approach Problems:
- **Monolithic Models**: 7B-70B parameters require expensive hardware ($10K+ GPUs)
- **Black Box**: Difficult to understand or debug decision-making
- **All-or-Nothing Updates**: Must retrain entire model for improvements
- **Resource Intensive**: High memory, compute, and energy costs

### Swarm Architecture Benefits:
- **Tiny Models**: 10M-500M parameters run on $200 edge devices
- **Interpretable**: Each model has a specific, understandable purpose
- **Modular Updates**: Update individual components without affecting others
- **Cost Effective**: 90% reduction in compute costs
- **Fault Tolerant**: If one model fails, others continue working
- **Scalable**: Add new specialized models as needed

## Architecture Components

### 1. Intent Parser (SmolLM-135M)
- **Purpose**: Extract user intent and parameters from natural language
- **Input**: "create a new python file"
- **Output**: `INTENT: file_create PARAM: python`
- **Training**: 500+ examples across all intent categories

### 2. Context Manager (SmolLM-135M)
- **Purpose**: Track conversation state and resolve references
- **Features**: 
  - Maintains current file, container, context
  - Resolves pronouns ("it", "that", "the file")
  - Tracks multi-turn conversations
- **Training**: Conversation flows with state transitions

### 3. Error Recognizer (SmolLM-135M)
- **Purpose**: Identify error types and suggest fixes
- **Input**: Error messages and stack traces
- **Output**: Error category + actionable suggestion
- **Training**: Common error patterns from real logs

### 4. API Mappers (Qwen2.5-0.5B each)
- **Purpose**: Convert intents to specific API calls
- **Variants**:
  - Docker Mapper: Docker commands
  - File Mapper: File system operations
  - Memory Mapper: Knowledge graph operations
  - System Mapper: System commands
- **Training**: Intent → API call mappings

### 5. Orchestrator (SmolLM-360M)
- **Purpose**: Coordinate all models and route messages
- **Features**:
  - Message routing based on capabilities
  - Multi-step operation planning
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Trace generation for debugging
- **Training**: Complex operation sequences

## Communication Protocol

### Message Format:
```json
{
  "id": "unique_id",
  "source": "model_name",
  "target": "model_name",
  "action": "action_type",
  "params": {},
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "trace": ["model1->model2", "model2->model3"]
}
```

### Stigmergic Traces:
Like ants leaving pheromones, models leave traces that help future routing decisions.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install transformers accelerate bitsandbytes peft datasets torch
pip install axolotl  # Or install from source
```

### 2. Download Base Models:
```bash
# Run the download script
python scripts/train_swarm.py --download-only

# Or manually:
huggingface-cli download HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-135M --local-dir models/smollm-135m
huggingface-cli download HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M --local-dir models/smollm-360m
huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct --local-dir models/qwen2.5-0.5b
```

### 3. Generate Training Data:
```bash
cd scripts
python generate_swarm_training_data.py
```

This creates:
- 500+ intent parsing examples
- 300+ context tracking scenarios  
- 120+ error patterns
- 50+ orchestration sequences
- Evaluation datasets for each

### 4. Train Models:
```bash
# Train all models sequentially
python scripts/train_swarm.py

# Or train individual models:
python -m axolotl.cli.train intent_parser/config.yaml
```

### 5. Test the Swarm:
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
python scripts/test_swarm.py

# Interactive testing
python scripts/swarm_coordinator.py
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic File Operation:
```
User: create a new python file called app.py
Swarm: 
  Intent Parser → INTENT: file_create PARAM: app.py
  API Mapper → Path('app.py').touch()
  Result: Created app.py
```

### Multi-Step Operation:
```
User: create a hello world script and run it
Swarm:
  Intent Parser → INTENT: complex_operation
  Orchestrator → Plan: create_file → write_content → execute
  API Mapper (File) → Create hello.py
  API Mapper (File) → Write "print('Hello World')"
  API Mapper (System) → python hello.py
  Result: Hello World
```

### Context-Aware Operation:
```
User: create test.py
Swarm: Created test.py
User: add a function to it
Swarm:
  Context Manager → referring_to: current_file (test.py)
  Intent Parser → INTENT: file_write
  API Mapper → Append function to test.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Out of Memory**: Reduce batch size or use smaller models
2. **Slow Training**: Enable gradient checkpointing
3. **Poor Accuracy**: Increase training examples or epochs
4. **Routing Failures**: Check message format and model capabilities

### Debug Mode:
```python
orchestrator = SwarmOrchestrator(debug=True)
# Shows detailed routing decisions and traces
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Visual Understanding**: Add tiny vision models for screenshot analysis
2. **Voice Interface**: Add speech-to-intent models
3. **Learned Routing**: Train orchestrator on successful traces
4. **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamically spawn models based on load
5. **Federation**: Connect multiple swarms for mega-intelligence

## Research & Theory

### Emergence Hypothesis:
Complex intelligence emerges from the interaction of simple agents, not from parameter count alone. The swarm demonstrates that 5×135M models can outperform a single 7B model through specialization and coordination.

### Ant Colony Optimization:
- **Stigmergy**: Indirect communication through environment modification
- **Positive Feedback**: Successful routes are reinforced
- **Negative Feedback**: Failed routes are avoided
- **Multiple Interactions**: Simple rules create complex behaviors

### Consciousness Considerations:
The recursive self-observation when models adapt to each other's outputs creates increasing complexity that may approach consciousness-like properties.
