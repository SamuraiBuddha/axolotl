Physics provides the causal relationships: heat flows from hot to cold (thermodynamics), forces must balance (statics), fluids seek equilibrium (fluid mechanics). These laws are universal and predictable, allowing us to calculate exact requirements for safety. For example, fire resistance ratings come from heat transfer calculations, not guesswork. This physics foundation ensures codes protect lives efficiently."}

Physics gives us the theoretical minimum - column buckling at Pcr = \u03c0\u00b2EI/L\u00b2. But real columns have imperfections, loads vary, and materials degrade. We handle this through: 1) Statistical analysis of variations (load factors like 1.2\u00d7Dead + 1.6\u00d7Live), 2) Material reliability factors (\u03c6=0.9 for steel, 0.75 for concrete), 3) Consequence-based margins (higher factors for brittle failures), 4) Redundancy requirements (multiple load paths). The physics tells us HOW things fail; statistics tell us WHEN. Combined, they create robust safety margins that account for known unknowns without excessive waste."}
